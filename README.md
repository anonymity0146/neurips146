## Requirements

1. The project was implemented and tested in Python 3.5 and Pytorch 1.0. Other versions should work after minor modification.
2. Other common modules like numpy, pandas and cv2 for visualization.
3. NVIDIA GPU and cuDNN are required to have fast speeds. For now, CUDA 8.0 with cuDNN 6.0.20 has been tested. The other versions should be working.

## Implementation details

### data preparation

To reproduce the results on [2] and [3], coco and wikiart datasets should be downloaded to the root path. Details can be accessed in project page and project page.

### stylization generation

1. To reproduce our basic results and ablation studys,

2. To reproduce comparison results across different architectures on [2],

3. To reproduce comparison results across different architectures on [3],
